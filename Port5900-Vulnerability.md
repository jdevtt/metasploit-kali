The Nmap scan identified a single host (192.168.1.11) on the network. It found that port 5900 is open and running the VNC (Virtual Network Computing) service. This service allows remote access to a computer's desktop.
**1. Target Information:**
* **IP Address:** 192.168.1.117
* **Port:** 5900 (VNC)

**2. Attack Configuration:**
* **Brute Force Speed:** 5 (Medium speed)
* **Password File:** `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/vnc passwords.txt`
* **Verbose Output:** (Detailed output)

**3. Exploit Code Analysis:**

As seen by the options the only necessary option is the Rhost, however users can set their own password file by running the following code

```ruby
use 'auxiliary/scanner/vnc'

set RHOSTS 'target_IP'
set PASS_FILE '/dir/to/your/password/list/.txt'

```

The console output shows a successful login attempt as well as showing the password in plain text as ```password```
